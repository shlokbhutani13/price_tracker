# Price Tracker (Web Scraper Demo)

This is a small web scraping demo that tracks a product’s price over time.

It works reliably with the demo site books.toscrape.com and tries best-effort parsing for other pages (some stores block bots, so you may see a “blocked/unsupported” message).

To run locally, install requirements and start the server with Uvicorn.

Live scraping is for learning and portfolio purposes only.
